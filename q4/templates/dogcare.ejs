            <h2>Dog Care Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Feeding</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Diet:</strong> <br>Choose a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for your dog’s
                            age, size, and health needs.<br>Puppies, adult dogs, and senior dogs have different
                            nutritional requirements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Portion size:</strong> <br>Follow the feeding guidelines on the dog food packaging
                            or consult with your vet to determine how much to feed. <br>Overfeeding can lead to obesity,
                            so monitor your dog's weight.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fresh water:</strong> <br>Always provide fresh water for your dog. <br>Some dogs may
                            drink more or less depending on their activity levels and weather conditions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Treats:</strong> <br>Treats should be given in moderation. <br>Ensure they are safe
                            and healthy, and avoid treats with too many calories.<br>Treats should make up no more than
                            10% of your dog's daily calorie intake.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Exercise & Mental Stimulation</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Regular exercise:</strong> <br>Dogs need daily exercise.<br> Depending on the breed
                            and energy level, this may include walks, runs, or playtime in the yard. <br>Aim for at
                            least 30 minutes to 1 hour of physical activity each day.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mental stimulation:</strong> <br>Dogs also need mental stimulation to keep them
                            engaged and happy.<br> Puzzle toys, training sessions, and interactive games help keep their
                            brains sharp.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Grooming</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Brushing:</strong> <br>Regular brushing helps to reduce shedding and prevent
                            matting, especially in long-haired breeds. <br>Brush your dog at least once a week, or more
                            frequently for dogs with thick or long coats.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bathing:</strong> <br>Dogs generally need a bath every 1-3 months, or as
                            needed.<br>Use dog-specific shampoos and make sure to rinse thoroughly.<Br>Frequent bathing
                            can dry out their skin, so avoid overdoing it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nail trimming:</strong> <br>Trim your dog's nails every 2-4 weeks or as
                            needed.<br>If you hear their nails clicking on the floor, it’s time for a trim. <br>Be
                            careful not to cut too short, as this can cause bleeding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ear care:</strong> Check your dog’s ears regularly for dirt or wax buildup.<br>Clean
                            the outer part of the ear with a damp cloth, and consult your vet if you notice signs of
                            infection (redness, odor, or discharge).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Health & Vet Care</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Vaccinations:</strong> <br>Keep your dog's vaccinations up to date according to your
                            vet's recommendations (typically annual or every 3 years). <br>This protects against common
                            diseases such as rabies, parvovirus, and distemper.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parasite prevention:</strong> <br>Use flea, tick, and heartworm preventatives
                            regularly, especially if your dog spends time outdoors. <br>Consult with your vet to
                            determine the right prevention plan.</li>
                        <li><strong>Annual check-ups:</strong> <br>Schedule regular vet visits to ensure your dog's
                            overall health. <br>Annual wellness exams include vaccinations, dental checkups, and
                            screenings for common issues like arthritis, diabetes, or heart disease.</li>
                        <li><strong>Signs of illness:</strong> <br>Be vigilant for signs of illness, such as changes in
                            appetite, behavior, weight, or bathroom habits. <br>If you notice anything unusual, visit
                            your vet promptly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Training & Socialization</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Basic commands:</strong> <br>Train your dog with basic commands such as sit, stay,
                            come, and leave it. <br>Positive reinforcement (treats and praise) works best to encourage
                            good behavior.</li>
                        <li><strong>Socialization:</strong> <br>Expose your dog to different people, animals, and
                            environments from an early age. <br>This helps them develop confidence and reduces the
                            likelihood of fear-based aggression or anxiety.</li>
                        <li><strong>Leash training:</strong> <br>Start leash training early to help your dog walk calmly
                            on a leash. <br>Use a comfortable collar or harness and teach them to walk beside you
                            without pulling.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Safety</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Secure your home:</strong> <br>Ensure that your home is safe for your dog. <br>Keep
                            hazardous items (like chemicals, sharp objects, or small items they could swallow) out of
                            reach. <br>Consider using baby gates to limit access to dangerous areas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Identification:</strong> <br>Make sure your dog has proper identification, such as a
                            collar with ID tags and a microchip. <br>This increases the chances of getting them back if
                            they get lost.</li>
                        <li><strong>Car safety:</strong> <br>Use a dog seat belt harness or a crate when traveling by
                            car to keep your dog safe and secure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Weather precautions:</strong><br>In extreme weather conditions (hot or cold), be
                            cautious about your dog’s exposure. <br>Never leave them in a parked car, and make sure they
                            have shelter and fresh water when outdoors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
