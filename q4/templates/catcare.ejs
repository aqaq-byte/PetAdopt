            <h2>Cat Care Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Feeding</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Diet:</strong> <br>Choose high-quality cat food that meets your cat's nutritional
                            needs. <br>You can offer a mix of wet and dry food. <br>Make sure the food is
                            age-appropriate (kitten, adult, senior).</li>
                        <li><strong>Portion size:</strong> <br>Follow the guidelines on the food packaging or consult
                            with your vet to determine how much to feed. <br>Overfeeding can lead to obesity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fresh water:</strong> <br>Always provide fresh water. <br>Some cats prefer running
                            water, so consider a cat water fountain.</li>
                        <li><strong>Treats:</strong> <br>Offer occasional treats, but don’t overdo it.<br>Treats should
                            make up no more than 10% of your cat’s daily intake.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Litter Box</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Location:</strong> <br>Place the litter box in a quiet, accessible area. <br>Make
                            sure it's easy for your cat to reach but not too close to food or water.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cleanliness:</strong> <br>Scoop the litter box at least once a day and change the
                            litter regularly (about once a week or more often depending on the number of cats).
                            <br>Clean the box with mild soap and water—avoid harsh chemicals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Litter type:</strong> <br>Some cats have preferences for certain types of litter.
                            <br>Try different kinds (clumping, non-clumping, silica gel, etc.) and observe which your
                            cat likes best.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Grooming</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Brushing:</strong> <br>Regular brushing helps prevent matting and reduces shedding.
                            <br>Short-haired cats may need less grooming, while long-haired cats require more frequent
                            brushing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nail trimming:</strong> <br>Trim your cat’s nails every 1-2 weeks. <br>If you’re
                            unsure how to do it, ask your vet to show you the proper technique.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bathing:</strong> <br>Cats generally don’t need baths unless they get into something
                            sticky or smelly. <br>If necessary, use a cat-specific shampoo.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Health & Vet Care</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Vaccinations:</strong> <br>Keep up with regular vaccinations as recommended by your
                            vet. <br>Usually they are yearly or every 3 years.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parasite prevention:</strong> <br>Regularly administer flea and tick preventatives
                            and deworming treatments as advised by your vet.</li>
                        <li><strong>Annual check-ups:</strong> <br>Schedule a yearly wellness check to monitor your
                            cat’s overall health.</li>
                        <li><strong>Signs of illness:</strong> <br>Watch for changes in behavior, appetite, litter box
                            habits, or weight. <br>If you notice anything unusual, consult your vet promptly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Environment & Enrichment</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Scratching:</strong> <br>Provide scratching posts or pads to satisfy your cat’s
                            natural urge to scratch. <br>This also helps protect your furniture.</li>
                        <li><strong>Toys & playtime:</strong> <br>Engage your cat with toys (balls, feathers, laser
                            pointers, etc.). <br>Regular playtime is important for their mental stimulation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Resting spots:</strong> <br>Cats love cozy spots to rest. <br>Offer soft beds,
                            blankets, or windowsills where they can observe the outdoors.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cat trees & climbing spaces:</strong> <br>Cats enjoy climbing and perching in high
                            places. <br>A cat tree or shelves can help satisfy this instinct.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Litter Box Training</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Young kittens:</strong> <br>Most kittens instinctively know where to use the litter
                            box. <br>Show them where it is, and they’ll likely start using it right away. <br>If they
                            have accidents, gently place them in the box after meals or naps.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accidents:</strong> <br>If your adult cat starts having accidents outside the box,
                            it could be due to stress, a health issue, or a dirty litter box. <br>Clean up accidents
                            thoroughly with an enzymatic cleaner to eliminate odors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bonding and Behavior</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Respect their space:</strong> <br>Cats are independent but still need companionship.
                            <br>Let them come to you for affection, but don’t force it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cuddles and attention:</strong> <br>Some cats love attention, while others prefer
                            more space. <br>Get to know your cat’s personality and respect their boundaries.</li>
                        <li><strong>Behavior problems:</strong> <br>If your cat exhibits unwanted behavior like
                            excessive meowing, scratching, or aggression, talk to your vet. <br>They can help identify
                            the cause, whether it’s physical or behavioral.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Safety</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Indoor vs. outdoor:</strong> <br>Indoor cats live longer, healthier lives than
                            outdoor cats. <br>If you do allow your cat outside, make sure they have a collar with ID
                            tags and consider microchipping.</li>
                        <li><strong>Toxic plants and foods:</strong> <br>Keep your cat away from toxic plants. <br>Some
                            include lilies, poinsettias, ivy and foods like chocolate, onions, and grapes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Secure your home:</strong> <br>Keep dangerous items like cleaning supplies, cords,
                            or small objects out of reach. <br>Make sure windows and balconies are secure.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
